# Neural-artistic-style-transfer
Neural Style Transfer we have two images- style and content. We need to copy the style from the style image and apply
it to the content image. By, style we basically mean, the patterns, the brushstrokes, etc.

Used vgg-19 pretrained model :http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/#downloading-the-pre-trained-models
This algorithm was created by Gatys et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
